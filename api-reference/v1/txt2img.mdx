### API key

Create your account on [RandomSeed](https://randomseed.co/signup) & grab your [api key](https://randomseed.co/api-reference/integrate)

### Headers

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string">
  Your API key. This is required by most endpoints to access our API programatically. You can get your api key by clicking on 'API reference' tab under your profile icon.
</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="prompt" type="string" required>
  This is the text prompt for the image you want generated. Loras can be used by adding this in the prompt `<lora:LORA_NAME:weight>` where LORA_NAME is the name of the lora model and weight can be from 0 to 1, with decimal values supported.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="negative_prompt" type="string" default="">
  This is the text prompt describing what you don't want to see in the image.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="width" type="string" default="512">
  This is the width of the image
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="height" type="string" default="512">
  This is the height of the image
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="number_of_images" type="string" default="1">
  Number of images you want to generate
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="steps" type="string" default="50">
  This is the number of the denoising steps used by the AI model when generating an image from the text prompt. A higher number results in a longer generation time, and does not necessarily guarantee higher image quality.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="cfg_scale" type="float" default="7.0">
  This is the number of the number you specify to control how closely AI model should follow the text prompt. 7 or 7.5 usually works best. You can increase the value if the generated image doesnâ€™t match your prompt. Increment it by 0.5.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="sampler_name" type="string" required>
  This is the name of the sampler method you will be using to generate an image. Image output varies slightly depending on the method.
  You can pick one of the [following methods](/documentation/sampler-methods)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="model_name" type="string" required>
  Specify the name of the model you'd like to use. You can find the model names [here](/api-reference/v1/models)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="highres_fix_method" type="string">
  Refer to the following [table](/documentation/highres-methods) for supported methods.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="image_strength" type="float" default="0.7">
  Make sure to set this value when you're using this when passing in the highres fix method.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhook" type="string">
  This is the callback url where you want to receive your response.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="track_id" type="string">
  You can specify any value here to track the request that's received on your webhook's end.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="seed" type="string" default="-1">
  This is the value that determines the output of a random number generator. You can get ALMOST the same image if you provide the same parameters and the seed.
</ParamField>


### Response

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
