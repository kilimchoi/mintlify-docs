### API key

Create your account [RandomSeed](https://randomseed.co/signup) & grab your [api key](https://randomseed.co/api-reference/integrate)

### Authentication

RandomSeed API uses your api key for authentication. **Please do not share your api key!**

All API requests should include your API key in an `Authorization` HTTP header as follows:
```md
Authorization: Bearer RANDOMSEED_API_KEY
```

### Making requests
Copy & paste the code block below in your terminal to make your first request.

```bash
curl --location 'https://randomseed.lol/v1/sync/txt2img' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $RANDOMSEED_API_KEY' \
  --data '{
      "txt2img": {
          "prompt": "Cute cat",
          "negative_prompt": "ugly, out of frame",
          "width": "512",
          "height": "512",
          "number_of_images": "1",
          "steps": "20",
          "cfg_scale": 7,
          "sampler_name": "Euler a",
          "seed": "-1",
          "model_name": "realistic_vision_v4",
      }
  }'
```
This makes a synchronous request to generate an image of a cat. You should get back a response that is like the following:

```bash
{
    "message": "image generated",
    "output": [
        "..."
    ]
}
```
